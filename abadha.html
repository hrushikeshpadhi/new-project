							<!--<h4>Augmentation of Basic Amenities and Development of Heritage and Architecture at Puri</h4>-->
							<p align="justify">
								The holy town of Puri is of enormous interest to tourists and hosts a floating population of more than 50,000 per day. It is estimated that at Puri, 500 to 1000 Cars, 1000 bikes and more than 500 buses ply on an everyday basis. One truly gets a whiff of the rich Odishi heritage by simply walking on the streets of Puri. It is also home to a wide array of interrelated crafts such as stone carving; the traditional miniature paintings (Patta) that refelect centuries of dedication and perfection; sophisticated Odishi textiles, dynamic visual and performing arts; and even the distinctive cuisine.


							</p>
							<p align="justify">
								Being a small town with narrow and congested lanes it has posed a massive challenge for planned development. In an attempt to rid the cultural landmarks of congestion and truly make Puri a Global Heritage hub, Sate Govt. has taken up this ambitious infrastructure augmentation with a preservationist mindset. As part of the augmentation, besides the notable development projects several other beautification initiatives are also being conceived. All development projects are being undertaken in consultation with Jagannath Temple Administration Trust.

                            Shree Setu, a 60 meter wide bridge would be built with a cost estimate of 180 Crore. The bridge would cover a total length of 1.5 kms and would have an Iconic Interchange connecting NH to Bada Danda.  A trumpet intersection with access control would lead straight to the Jagannath Ballav Mutt. In addition, the bridge would have viewpoints offering sights of Shree Mandir and Musa River.
